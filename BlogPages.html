            The event was supported by government co-ed school site-1, Principal Mr. P K Pradeep, Vice Principal Mrs. Garima Gupta, volunteers, students, Mr. Anshul (co-founder), and Mrs. Rajni Joshi (Director of PRJ CARE FOUNDATION).

            The Greenmask Plantation Drive Project, undertaken by PRJ CARE FOUNDATION, aims to preserve our beautiful environment. 
            The environment is an intricate web of interconnected systems that encompass our planet, including the air we breathe, the water we drink, and the ecosystems that support all life. It is a delicate balance that sustains biodiversity, climate stability, and human well-being.
            However, human activities like pollution, deforestation, and the release of greenhouse gases are placing immense strain on the environment, leading to climate change, species extinction, and environmental degradation. 
            It is imperative that we prioritize conservation, sustainable practices, and collective action to protect and restore our environment for future generations.

        <p> The drive kick started off with the interns carrying saplings and pots till the Govt. Co-ed school, Dwarka sec-6. 
            Slogans namely 'Ped lagao, Prakriti bachao', 'Prakriti ki Raksha,Duniya ki Suraksha' & 'Saanse ho rhi kam, Aao Ped lagaye hum' were chanted throughout the journey till school.

          <p> On reaching the school, our members interacted with the principal who led us to the barren land that needed trees. 
              We began ploughing the ground and planting the trees one by one. Around 20-30 trees were planted.

    <div class="conclusion intro">
        <p> PRJCare managed to successfully complete the desired goal of planting all the saplings. An awareness programme was then conducted where our interns spoke about the importance of trees and their role on our planet.
            Further, they also highlighted the disadvantages of cutting down trees and the disastrous consequences that it would lead to.
        </p>
         <p>
            The entire aim of this Plantation drive was not just about planting tress but to spread more knowledge of tree plantation and it's positive impact on the environment like climate,wildlife and promoting community involvement. 
            The joy of planting a tree and nurturing it was felt by everyone who made this drive a success.
            PRJCare strives to continue maintaining our role towards a cleaner and greener planet and contribute to better biodiversity and a more sustainable future with such events and activities.
