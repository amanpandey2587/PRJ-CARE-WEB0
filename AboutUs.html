        PRJC aims to build an equitable relationship of strength, sustenance,
        and dignity between the cities and villages, using under-utilized
        material as a tool to trigger development with dignity. We envision
        growing as an idea across regions, economies, and countries using urban
        surplus material as a tool to address basic but neglected issues of the
        financially and materially poor, involving them in designing and
        implementing their own solutions, with their own efforts, knowledge, and
        dignity, and material as a reward for their participation.

        Human dignity and the world’s surplus are at the core of our idea,
        ensuring that our actions never undermine the dignity of self, those we
        work with, and, most importantly, those we stand with. Besides that, we:
        Value localized solutions by engaging local resources, wisdom, and
        efforts. Improve before we Change; always value and explore the
        potential of what the world already has, focusing on circularity –
        material, people, relationships, talent or resources. Value
        collaboration in every sphere to increase effectiveness and scale. See
        every entity as a stakeholder in the process of development. Focus on
        the missed-out; people, material, needs, issues, geographies and
        relationships.

        Since 1999, PRJC has built a network of communities from urban to
        village India, channelizing material as a tool to address crucial gaps
        in rural infrastructure, water, environment, livelihood, education,
        health, disaster relief and rehabilitation. Its engagement with both the
        urban and rural population has galvanized a mass civic participation in
        addressing basic but neglected issues. PRJC’s model of development
        implemented through its various Initiatives proposes a more inclusive
        alternative economy where everyone is an equal stakeholder in the
        process.s
